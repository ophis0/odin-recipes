      <p>
        Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation method.
        It's cooked short-grain white rice combined with rice vinegar and other
        ingredients, cooled completely, and then used to make sushi rolls.

      <h3 class="header1">Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="header1">Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander under cold running water
          until the water runs clear.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring
          to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender
          and all water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from stove
          and set aside until cool enough to handle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small
          saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved. Allow
          to cool, then stir into the cooked rice. While mixture will appear
          very wet at first, keep stirring and rice will dry as it cools.
