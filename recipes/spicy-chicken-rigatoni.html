    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A popular dish in upstate New York, where my boyfriend is from. It's a
      spicy chicken and tomato-based sauce ladled over fat rigatoni pasta. Not
      for the meek who are afraid of heat!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) box rigatoni pasta</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 large shallot, chopped</li>
      <li>
        3 boneless chicken thighs, cut into small pieces, or more to taste
      </li>
      <li>5 fresh cherry peppers, thinly sliced, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup dry sherry</li>
      <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 small bunch fresh basil leaves, torn</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 13 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat butter and oil together in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
        Add garlic and shallot to the skillet; cook and stir until fragrant and
        shallots are translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken; cook and stir
        until it is no longer pink and the internal temperature reads at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cherry peppers into chicken mixture; cook until soft, 5 to 7
        minutes. Stir in tomato sauce; mix thoroughly. Lower heat to medium and
        simmer, 7 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour sherry into tomato sauce mixture; simmer, stirring occasionally,
        about 10 minutes. Pour in milk and simmer, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat and mix in torn basil leaves. Spoon tomato sauce over
        pasta to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
